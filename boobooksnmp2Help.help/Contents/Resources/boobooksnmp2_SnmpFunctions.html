<h2>SNMP Functions</h2>

</ul>
Basic set of SNMP functions is supported. Requests are threaded for simultaneous execution. <br>
All output is displayed in Query Results View.<br>
<h3><a name="Get"></a>Get</h3>
Executes a SNMP Get request for data in Agent View and Object view.<br>
<h3><a name="Walk"></a>Walk</h3>
Executes a SNMP Walk request for data in Agent View and Object view.
SNMP walk function executes successive snmp get next requests and these
requests are sequential, that is one thread is created for snmp walk
function that in turn executes synchronous(one at a time) snmp get next
request.<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="Get_Next"></a>Get Next</h3>
Executes a SNMP Get Next request for data in Agent View and Object view.<br>
<h3><a name="Set"></a>Set</h3>
Executes SNMP Set request for date in Agenet View and Object View.<br>
<h3><a name="Get_Bulk"></a>Get Bulk</h3>
SNMP Bulk implementation is done as to enable ability to query multiple
Agents for multiple Objects. Selecting this action will trigger
collection of all Agents and Objects selected in Bookmarks View and
executing (queuing) of SNMP GET request for each Agent for each Object.
All requests are threaded and are executed as fast as the OS can
process them.<br>
Selecting a Folder in Bookmark View means you are selecting all Agents and Objects in that Folder.<br>
<h3><a name="Cancel_All_Requests"></a>Cancel All Requests</h3>
SNMP requests are threaded so each request is queued and executed in
background. This has flexibility to schedule multiple requests and not
have to wait until first task finished executing. Results are populated
in current Query Results View in order tasks are finished executing. As
a consequence to cancel a request means stopping all requests, and
suppressing any further output. <br>
