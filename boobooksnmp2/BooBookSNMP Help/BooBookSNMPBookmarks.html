    <h2>Bookmarks</h2>

Bookmarks are there for fast access to commonly used Objects, Agents,
and websites containing documentation for references. Doubleclicking on a bookmark will perform the following depending on bookmark type: 
<ul>
<li>URL - opens it in a tab view or default browser (see preferenecs)</li>
<li>Agent - populates that agent information in the Agent Box used for SNMP requests</li>
<li>Oid - populates OID informatin in Oid Box used for SNMP requests</li>
</ul>

Use drag and drop (of selected bookmarks) to organize them into groups. Performing a drop on a bookmark will add them under that object.
<br>
<br>
You may bookmark OIDs by dragging them from MIB tree onto the bookmarks area.
<br>
<br>
Dragging a URL from your web browser (Safari, Chrome, other) onto Boobooksnmp2 bookmarks area will add that URL as bookmark.
