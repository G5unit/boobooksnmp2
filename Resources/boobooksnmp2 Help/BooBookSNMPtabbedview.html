<h3><a name="Query_Results"></a>Query Results</h3>

Query results are displayed in the Query tab. Multiple query tabs could
be present. When a query is executed such as SNMP get,
results are populated in the current Query tab, or if another tabbed
view is currently selected, data is populated in the last query tab
present. If no Query tab is present, a new Query tab will be added.<br>

Data is presented in a table format, columns can be spaced and
reorganized, rows can be removed via cmd-click menu.<br>

<h3><a name="MIB_File_View"></a>MIB File View</h3>

File View is used to display the MIB file that Object was read from. If
an Object is selected the file it was read from is displayed in the
Object view. If this entry is present clicking on the Mib File toolbar
icon will open that file as text in a tab view that could be examined,
searched through, etc.<br>

<h3><a name="Webpage_View"></a>Webpage View</h3>

Bookmarked URLs can be opened in a Tabbed Web View. Each URL is opened
in a new tab. As this functionality is not meant to replace a web
browser, regular browser functions are not implemented. The use of this
is intended for storing references for easy retrieval.<br>
<br>
Under Preferences you may choose to open URL bookmarks in your system default browser.

<h3><a name="Log_View"></a>Log View</h3>

Log View displays log messages reported by libnetsnmp when it loads MIB files. You may clear contents of the log using the toolbar icon.<br>
<br>
Under Preferences you may choose log level reported by libnetsnmp.
